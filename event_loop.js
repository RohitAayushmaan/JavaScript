// The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the task queue.
// If the call stack is empty, it takes the first task from the task queue 
// and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

// Once the task is executed, the event loop goes back to monitoring the
// call stack and the task queue, repeating the process.
